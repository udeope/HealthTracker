# Wearable Device Integration System

## Overview

The Wearable Device Integration System is a comprehensive solution for connecting to, synchronizing, and managing health data from various wearable devices and health platforms. The system supports Apple Health, Google Fit, and Fitbit, with a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new platforms in the future.

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following components:

### Core Components

1. **WearableIntegration**: The main entry point and facade for the entire system.
2. **Connectors**: Platform-specific modules for connecting to and fetching data from each supported platform.
3. **DataSyncManager**: Manages the synchronization process, including scheduling and error handling.
4. **DataValidator**: Validates health data to ensure it meets quality standards.
5. **DataNormalizer**: Normalizes data from different sources to ensure consistent units and formats.
6. **AnomalyDetector**: Identifies anomalies in health data.
7. **BackupManager**: Manages data backups.
8. **SyncLogger**: Logs synchronization activities for troubleshooting.
9. **BatteryOptimizer**: Optimizes battery usage during synchronization.
10. **ConfigManager**: Manages system configuration.

### Data Flow

1. User connects to a wearable platform (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit)
2. System authenticates with the platform using OAuth 2.0
3. System fetches health data from the platform
4. Data is validated to ensure integrity
5. Data is normalized to ensure consistent units and formats
6. Anomalies are detected and flagged
7. Data is stored in the application database
8. Backups are created according to the configured schedule

## Setup and Configuration

### Installation

```typescript
// Import the main integration class
import { WearableIntegration } from '@/lib/wearable-integration';

// Create an instance with default configuration
const wearableIntegration = new WearableIntegration();

// Or with custom configuration
const wearableIntegration = new WearableIntegration({
  syncIntervalMinutes: 30,
  batteryOptimizationLevel: 'medium',
  syncHistoricalData: true,
  historicalDataDays: 7
});
```

### Connecting to Platforms

```typescript
// Connect to Apple Health
await wearableIntegration.initializeConnector(
  WearableDataSource.APPLE_HEALTH,
  { userId: 'current-user-id' }
);

// Connect to Google Fit
await wearableIntegration.initializeConnector(
  WearableDataSource.GOOGLE_FIT,
  { 
    userId: 'current-user-id',
    clientId: 'your-google-client-id',
    redirectUri: 'your-redirect-uri'
  }
);

// Connect to Fitbit
await wearableIntegration.initializeConnector(
  WearableDataSource.FITBIT,
  {
    userId: 'current-user-id',
    clientId: 'your-fitbit-client-id',
    clientSecret: 'your-fitbit-client-secret',
    redirectUri: 'your-redirect-uri'
  }
);
```

### Starting Synchronization

```typescript
// Start automatic synchronization
await wearableIntegration.startSync();

// Manually trigger a sync
await wearableIntegration.syncNow();

// Sync specific metrics
await wearableIntegration.syncNow([
  HealthMetricType.STEPS,
  HealthMetricType.HEART_RATE
]);

// Stop synchronization
wearableIntegration.stopSync();
```

### Configuration

```typescript
// Update configuration
wearableIntegration.updateConfig({
  syncIntervalMinutes: 60,
  batteryOptimizationLevel: 'high',
  anomalyDetectionThreshold: 2.5
});

// Get current sync status
const status = wearableIntegration.getSyncStatus();
```

## Supported Health Metrics

The system supports a wide range of health metrics, including:

- **Activity Metrics**: Steps, distance, active minutes, calories burned, floors climbed
- **Vital Metrics**: Heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, body temperature
- **Sleep Metrics**: Sleep sessions, sleep stages
- **Body Metrics**: Weight, body fat, BMI
- **Nutrition Metrics**: Water intake, nutrition
- **Other Metrics**: ECG, stress level, mindfulness minutes

## Security and Privacy

The system implements several security measures:

1. **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure authentication with each platform
2. **Data Encryption**: Optional encryption of health data
3. **Secure Backups**: Encrypted backups with configurable retention policies
4. **Access Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all data access

## Battery Optimization

The system includes battery optimization features:

1. **Configurable Sync Interval**: Adjust how frequently data is synced
2. **Battery Level Awareness**: Skip syncs when battery is low
3. **Charging State Detection**: Perform more intensive operations when charging
4. **Optimization Levels**: Choose between different optimization levels

## Error Handling and Logging

The system includes robust error handling and logging:

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs of all synchronization activities
2. **Error Classification**: Errors are categorized for easier troubleshooting
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Failed operations are retried with exponential backoff
4. **Validation Errors**: Data validation errors are logged and reported

## Extending the System

The system is designed to be extensible:

1. **Adding New Platforms**: Create a new connector class implementing the WearableConnector interface
2. **Custom Validation Rules**: Add custom validation rules for specific metrics
3. **Custom Normalization Rules**: Add custom normalization rules for specific metrics
4. **Custom Anomaly Detection**: Customize anomaly detection thresholds and algorithms

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Authorization Failures**: Check that your OAuth credentials are correct and that the user has granted the necessary permissions
2. **Sync Errors**: Check the sync logs for specific error messages
3. **Missing Data**: Ensure that the user has data for the requested metrics in the source platform
4. **Battery Drain**: Adjust the sync interval and battery optimization level
